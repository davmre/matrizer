- Sparse matrices
- Blocked or block-diagonal matrices
- Woodbury matrix inversion lemma
- Optimizations for the optimizer:
  	- Bounded-depth search to allow for cyclic rewrite rules
	- Heuristics for guiding search
	- Optimizer should 'show its work' and return a list of
          rewrite rules applied
- Other matrix operations (with appropriate optimizer rewrite rules):
  	- decompositions: eigenvalue, SVD, QR
	- determinant and trace
	- diag() operator
	- matrix derivatives
	- Kronecker and Hadamard (pointwise) products
- Other matrix properties:
  	- unitary
  	- stochastic
	- rotation matrices (always commute with each other)
	- real/complex
	- singular / invertible
- Explicit consideration of numeric stability (currently we just
  assume that fewer FLOPs is better). Give each matrix a condition
  number, then calculate stability of the resulting expression.
