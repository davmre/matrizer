- Special-case the identity matrix
- Assignment operator to allow temporary variables (and corresponding optimization of common subexpressions)
- Scalars
- Sparse matrices
- Blocked or block-diagonal matrices
- Woodbury matrix inversion lemma
- Optimizations for the optimizer:
  	- Bounded-depth search to allow for cyclic rewrite rules
	- Heuristics for guiding search
- Other matrix operations (with appropriate optimizer rewrite rules):
  	- decompositions: eigenvalue, SVD, QR
	- determinant and trace
	- diag() operator
	- matrix derivatives
	- Kronecker and Hadamard (pointwise) products
